            <p class="para">In order to maximize your results from the gym, you must focus on your diet, as eating the

                competitor's physical appearance rather than physical strength.</p>
            <p class="para">As such, Bodybuilders aspire to develope and maintain a well-balanced, lean and muscular
                physique.</p>
            <p class="para">To do this, many bodybuilders start with an off-season followed by an in-season way of

            <p class="para">During the bulking phase, which can last months to years, bodybuilders eat a high-calorie,
                protein-rich diet and lift weights intensely with the goal of building as much muscle as possible
                (1Trusted Source).</p>
            <p class="para">The following cutting phase focuses on losing as much fat as possible while maintaining
                muscle mass developed during the bulking phase. This is achieved through specific changes in diet and

                <strong>Summary</strong>
                <p>Bodybuilding training and dieting is typically divided into two phases: bulking and cutting. The goal
                    of the bulking phase is to build muscle, whereas the cutting phase is dedicated to preserving muscle
                    while losing body fat.</p>

            <strong style="font-size: large;" id="benefits">Benefits Of Bodybuilding</strong>
            <p class="para">There are several health benefits associated with bodybuilding.</p>
            <p class="para">In order to maintain and build muscles, bodybuilders exercise frequently, performing both
                resistance and aerobic training.</p>
            <p class="para">Resistance training increases muscle strength and size. Muscle strength is highly correlated
                with a lower risk of dying from cancer, heart and kidney disease, as well as several other critical
                illnesses (2Trusted Source).</p>
            <p class="para">Aerobic exercise, which bodybuilders regularly implement to reduce body fat, improves heart
                health and significantly lowers your risk of developing or dying from heart disease — the number one
                killer in America (3Trusted Source, 4Trusted Source).</p>
            <p class="para">In addition to exercise, bodybuilders also focus on their nutrition.</p>
            <p class="para">With careful planning, bodybuilders can eat in a way that not only supports their efforts in
                the gym but keeps them healthy too.</p>
            <p class="para">Following a healthy eating pattern, including nutrient-dense foods from all food groups in
                appropriate amounts, can significantly lower your risk of chronic diseases (5Trusted Source).</p>
            <blockquote class="summary">
                <strong>Summary</strong>
                <p>Bodybuilders exercise regularly and may eat well-planned and nutrient-dense diets, both of which
                    offer many health benefits.</p>

            <div class="css-1tuviqo"></div>
            <strong style="font-size: large;" id="calories">Calorie Needs and Macronutrients</strong>
            <p class="para">The goal for competitive bodybuilders is to increase muscle mass in the bulking phase and
                reduce body fat
                in the cutting phase. Hence, you consume more calories in the bulking phase than in the cutting phase.
            </p>
            <strong style="font-size: large;">How many calories do you need ?</strong>
            <p class="para">The easiest way to determine how many calories you need is to weigh yourself at least three
                times a week and record what you eat using a calorie tracking app.</p>
            <p class="para">If your weight stays the same, the daily number of calories you eat is your maintenance
                calories — in other words, you’re not losing or gaining weight, but maintaining it.</p>
            <p class="para">During your bulking phase, it’s recommended to increase your calorie intake by 15%. For
                example, if your maintenance calories are 3,000 per day, you should eat 3,450 calories per day (3,000 x
                0.15 = 450) during your bulking phase (6Trusted Source).</p>
            <p class="para">When transitioning from a bulking to a cutting phase, you would instead decrease your
                maintenance calories by 15%, meaning you would eat 2,550 calories per day instead of 3,450.</p>
            <p class="para">As you gain weight in the bulking phase or lose weight in the cutting phase, you will need
                to adjust your calorie intake at least monthly to account for changes in your weight.</p>
            <strong style="font-size: large;" id="table">Macronutrient Ratio</strong>
            <p class="para">Protein and carbs contain four calories per gram, and fat contains nine.</p>

            <p class="para">While you should include a variety of foods in your diet, there are some you should limit.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li class="list"><strong>Alcohol:</strong> Alcohol can negatively affect your ability to build muscle
                    and lose fat,
                    especially if you consume it in excess (8Trusted Source).
                </li>
                <li class="list"><strong>Added sugars:</strong> These offer plenty of calories but few nutrients. Foods
                    high in added
                    sugars include candy, cookies, doughnuts, ice cream, cake and sugar-sweetened beverages, such as
                    soda and sports drinks(5Trusted Source).</li>
                <li class="list"><strong>Deep-fried foods:</strong> These may promote inflammation and — when consumed
                    in excess —
                    disease. Examples include fried fish, french fries, onion rings, chicken strips and cheese curds
                    (9Trusted Source).</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="para">In addition to limiting these, you may also want to avoid certain foods before going to the
                gym that can slow digestion and cause stomach upset during your workout.</p>
            <ul>
                <li class="list"><strong>High-fat foods:</strong> High-fat meats, buttery foods and heavy sauces or
                    creams.</li>
                <li class="list"><strong>High-fiber foods:</strong> Beans and cruciferous vegetables like broccoli or
                    cauliflower.</li>
                <li class="list"><strong>Carbonated beverages:</strong> Sparkling water or diet soda.</li>
